# CVE-2019-5420 PoC

A remote code execution vulnerability in development mode Rails <5.2.2.1, <6.0.0.beta3 can allow an attacker to guess the automatically generated development mode secret token. This secret token can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a remote code execution exploit. This PoC code for CVE-2019-5420 escalates the privileges to admin account without the remote code execution itself.

# How to use

Copy the value of the cookie and replace it with "VALUE_OF_THE_COOKIE" at line 11:

`cookie = CGI.unescape "VALUE_OF_THE_COOKIE"  # put in the value of your cookie here`

Furthermore, replace "NAME::Application" with the name of your application. For example, if the applications name is "test", it would be "test::Application":

`secret = Digest::MD5.hexdigest("NAME::Application") # the name of the ruby on rails application, either bruteforce or have to be known directly`

Run the exploit and copy the output of the cookie. Replace it with the cookie of the web application:

`ruby CVE-2019-5420.rb`
